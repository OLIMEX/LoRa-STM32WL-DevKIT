Hardware revision D1

Overview: major changes

1. Changed temperature and humidty sensor to AHT20 (from BME280). This requires software changes.

2. FET2 changed to P-MOS and added processor control from PB12 pin. FET2 controlls UEXT and AHT20 power supply. To allow the powering set PB12 to low.

3. Adjusted several component labels and improved the schematic layout.

4. Changes of several capacitors and other less important components.
